# Mon Feast
## A candy-shattering combo crunching experience.

This game was a culmination of a term of taking NM3216 - the game development course at NUS.
It incorporates many principles of game development, include game mechanics, dynamics, adaptive difficulty, and "juiciness".

The game revolves around smashing down on candies matching your color and watching the combos roll!

Once your meter fills up, press up to super-smash, wreaking even more chain-breaking madness.
